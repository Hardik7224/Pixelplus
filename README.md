A **real-time Facial Expression Detection System** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **Deep Learning**. This system can detect key human emotions from your webcam in real-time.  

---

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time facial expression detection using webcam.
- Detects **7 key emotions**:
> 😄 Happy
> 😢 Sad
> 😠 Angry
> 😐 Neutral
> 😲 Surprise
> 😨 Fear
> 🤢 Disgust
- User-friendly interface with live feedback.
- Utilizes deep learning for accurate predictions.

## 💻 Installation

Open your terminal and run the following commands step by step:

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/Hardik7224/Pixelplus.git && cd face_emotion_identifier
````

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace "venv" with your preferred name)
python -m venv venv
````

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux / macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
````

```bash
# Install all required dependencies
pip install -r Requirements.txt
````

```bash
# Run the application
python face_emotion_identifier/main.py
````

## 📂 Project Structure

## ⚙️ How It Works
 1. Captures live video feed from the webcam using OpenCV
 2. Detects faces in each frame using face_locator.py
 3. Processes faces through the deep learning model in emotion_model.py
 4. Uses overlay_utils.py to display the predicted emotion on the screen in real-time
 5. Main application logic runs in main.py
